VAGRANT
=========

The main purpose of this article is documenting how to face a problem with the machine storage in vagrant,
and also we will see briefly how to install it.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Basic information
-----------------

- **Official documentation:** https://www.vagrantup.com/

Tested on (Requirements)
------------------------

- **Base OS:** Fedora 31
- **OS for the virtual machine:** CentOS 8

Installation and implementation
--------------------------------

#. Search the name of the vagrant package in your packet manager and install it, then make some directory to locate
   the machines we will create

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install vagrant #install vagrant

#. Create a directory where you will work with vagrant and enter into it.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mkdir Desktop/vagrant
      $ cd Desktop/vagrant

#. Initialize the directory with Vagrant, it will generate a new file called Vagrantfile, it will be the
   base for vagrant.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant init

#. Then download the plugin that will help for changing the size of our virtual machine

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize

#. Enter to the file and edit it with the options you want to your Vagrant machine such as hostname,
   network interfaces, bootstrap script, vagrant box, etc. (You can read more about boxes at [1]_).
   For example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      BOX_IMAGE = "bento/centos-8.1"
      NODE_COUNT = 2

      Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
        config.vm.box = BOX_IMAGE
        config.disksize.size = '50GB' #the plugin we've previously installed
        config.vm.define "controller" do |ctrlr|
          ctrlr.vm.hostname = "ctrlr.test.lan"
          ctrlr.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.50.2"
          ctrlr.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.name = "Controller"
          end
        end
      end

#. In the same folder where the Vagrant file is located run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ vagrant up

#. Go to the new machine using ssh.

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ vagrant ssh

#. Looking at the vm's space we find out the following:

    .. image:: img/doc1.png

#. Then we try to expand the space through the commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo cfdisk #change the space, and write to the disk

- It should look like this:

.. image:: img/doc2.png

- Here we have to resize the disk clicking on the **Write** option

.. image:: img/doc3.png

-  Then enter and exit, after that process run the following commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo xfs_growfs -d / #for making the changes
      $ df -h #for checking if it worked
