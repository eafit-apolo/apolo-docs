Sensu Plugin - CPU Load
=========================

Checks the average CPU load in the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes, establishing a warning and a caution threshold
for each one of these time intervals.

Installation
------------

.. note:: This installation process has to be performed in each Sensu
          Client that will execute this monitoring task.

Install the plugin executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sensu-install -p loads-checks

This command will install the corresponding Gem. Its scripts are located
in :bash:`/opt/sensu/embedded/bin/`, that directory is included in the Sensu
user's PATH, so in the check definition, it's not necessary to write the full path.

The scripts are:

* bin/check-cpu.rb
* bin/check-cpu.sh
* bin/metrics-cpu-mpstat.rb
* bin/metrics-cpu-pcnt-usage.rb
* bin/metrics-numastat.rb
* bin/metrics-user-pct-usage.rb

Usage
-------

Add the Check-CPU-load configuration, specifying which will be its subscribers and its warning and critical thresholds. The units of the thresholds is load/core.

**Example:** If the machine has 16 cores and we want 18 for the critical threshold, the value is 1.125 (18/16).

   .. literalinclude:: ../src/checks/check-cpu-load.json
      :language: bash

In this example, the check will be in WARNING state if the CPU load is greater than 15,15,14 in the last 1,5 and 15 minutes
respectively, and CRITICAL state if the CPU load is greater than 20,18,18 in the last 1,5 and 15 minutes respectively.

So, with a machine of 16 cores, the values are 0.9365, 0.9365, 0.875 for the Warning threshold and 1.25, 1.125, 1.125 for the Critical threshold.
