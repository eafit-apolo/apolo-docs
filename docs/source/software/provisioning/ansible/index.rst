Deployment strategy
---------------------

Ensuring the system’s state remains as desired after deployment
requires constant monitoring of configuration files, daemons (services), etc.
Bearing this in mind, employing a self-aware architecture—in which tasks
are not run once, but repeatedly and their actions are performed
based on checking the system state—is a reasonable choice.

To further ease deployment one may find useful to provision a server, or set of servers,
by using wrappers triggering ansible’s execution, one-shot playbooks and scripts.

This section proposes an architecture integrating all the abovementioned ideas.
