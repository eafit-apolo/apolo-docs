MATLAB
======

MATLAB [1]_ (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing
environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks.

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data,
implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with
programs written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and
Python.

Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional
toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing
abilities. An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain
simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems.
