What should be the CPU Load on my node?
---------------------------------------
The CPU Load is the measure of the amount of computational work that a compute
node has been performing. It is always a good idea to keep monitoring this
measure while you are computing in order to know how well your job is running
and if it agrees with the given parameters.

To do this, we are going to log in to the compute node (or nodes) where your
job is running on, then we are going to use htop_. For example, ``compute-0-0``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh compute-0-0
    $ htop

.. warning::

  You must have a running job on the compute node that you will log in to,
  otherwise, you will not be able to do it. In case you have an active session
  on a compute node and all of your jobs have finished their execution, Slurm is
  going to kill all the user's remaining processes on that node, including your current session.

On the htop_. screen you will find all the running processes of that node.

The first thing you should check is if there's ``n`` number of running process plus
one (the htop process).

Now, check the CPU load, htop display 3 different values: the Average of 1 minute,
5 minutes and 15 minutes. As a general rule, you should expect that the values
will be the number of running cores that you asked for in your sbatch script, in
most of the cases is the same number of tasks ``n``.

In this example, we ran a job in :ref:`Cronos <about_cronos>` with 16 processes.
Here, are the sbatch parameters.

.. code-block :: bash

   #SBATCH --ntasks=16
   #SBATCH --time=30:00

And here, is the screen of htop_ corresponding to the compute node that was running that job after
3 minutes.

.. image:: src/info/images/htop2.png

and here is the screen of htop_ on the same node after 20 minutes.

.. image:: src/info/images/htop1.png

As you can see, there is **17** running process (16 tasks + htop) and the load
average is close to ``16.00``. All the cores (``16``) are in use.

Do not mind if you find that your ``CPUs Load`` is less than expected, it does
not necessarily mean that your job is not running in an optimal way. It could be
due that your application can not reach that CPU load, for example, it
frequently does ``I/O`` processing.

.. warning::

  However, if you have a considerably high ``CPUs Load``
  (e.g ``40.00``, ``50.00``, ``300.00``), no matter the case, this is
  **not a good thing** and it will affect substantially
  the performance of your job. You are **OVER LOADING** the node.


In which cases should I use ``srun``?
-------------------------------------
There are three different ways in which jobs can be run by users in Slurm, using:
``srun``, ``salloc`` and ``sbatch``.

``srun`` is used to create an interactive job, this means the job is going to
be linked with the current ``tty`` and ``session`` of the user. If you disconnect it,
you will lose control over the job, or it might be killed. In case the resources that
you specified are not available, you will need to wait, keeping the session alive.
The ``std_out`` and ``std_err`` will be written in your terminal.

``salloc`` is used to create jobs in allocated mode, the user is able to allocate
resources and, if available, interactively run jobs steps under that allocation
using a sub-shell created by Slurm. For further information see ``man salloc``.

``sbatch`` is used to submit a job for later execution using a script. We have
documentation about in the :ref:`submit <submit>` section.

When you use ``srun`` inside a ``sbatch`` script, ``srun`` takes all the
parameters given to that script, once the needed resources of your job are available and
your job is ready to start running, ``srun`` will communicate to the Slurm compute node
daemons to launch the ``ntasks`` of your job as it was specified.

In conclusion, as a **short answer**, you **need** to use ``srun`` inside your sbatch scripts
when your job uses more than **one** ``ntask`` in order to allow Slurm to distribute these
tasks in the cluster. Otherwise, the number of ``ntasks`` won't take effect and
the job will be serial. Thus, you should use ``srun`` inside your MPI and Array
jobs, in the :ref:`submit <submit>` section we have some examples of these cases.

What is the difference between ``N``, ``n`` and ``c``?
------------------------------------------------------
``N`` refers to the number of **Nodes**. Nodes can compute one or more
**tasks** (``n``), ideally a **node** can compute up to its number of cores at the same time, also
depending on the specific application. Each task has one or more  **threads** (``c``).
We recommend to specify ``n`` tasks rather than ``N`` nodes, you should let 
Slurm decides how many machines your job needs. 

Here_ is a good explanation about the difference between Process and Threads.

How to know the name(s) of the allocated node(s) inside my job ?
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
The are cases where is useful to know which node(s) has been allocated to run my 
job. In order to make your script dynamic, you can ask Slurm that information using:

.. code-block:: bash
   
     # SBATCH PAMATERTS

     scontrol show hostname > hostnames.out

     # job steps

This example store the name of the allocated machines in the file ``hostname.out``.
You can use it inside a ``sbatch`` script or as a command in a ``salloc``
sub-shell.
