.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   installation	      
      	
Usage
-----
In the following example we are going to run a test included in the source code
of **BayeSacan**. Note that we are using one single compute-node, with 16
threads.

.. literalinclude:: src/bayescan_run.sh
       :language: bash
       :caption: :download:`slurm.sh <src/bayescan_run.sh>`
	     
To run the previous example.

.. code-block:: bash
		
   sbatch bayescan_run.sh

.. note::

     In this example we are using the default version of **BayeScan**
     module. We recommend to specify the version. To use the
     version of this entry, pleace load the module as follow: 
      

      In Apolo II:

      .. code-block:: bash

	 module load bayescan/2.1_intel-2017_update-1

      In Cronos:

      .. code-block:: bash

	 module load bayescan/2.1_intel-18.0.2


	 
Performance Tests
-----------------
The following test was performed in :ref:`Cronos <about_cronos>`.
We were comparing the build-in version and our builded version described in this
entry. As input, we use one of the included tests of **BayeScan** source.

sbatch script for build-in version test:

.. literalinclude:: src/sbatch
     :language: bash


The test for our **builded version** was executed by the example provided in
`Usage`_ section of this entry.

.. note::
    As you can see in the sbatch script, the time was calculated using
    ``time`` command.
