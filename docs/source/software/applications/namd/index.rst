Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics [1]_ (formerly Not Another Molecular Dynamics Program) 
is computer software for molecular dynamics simulation, written using the 
Charm++ parallel programming model. It is noted for its parallel efficiency and 
is often used to simulate large systems (millions of atoms). 
It has been developed by the collaboration of the Theoretical and Computational 
Biophysics Group (TCB) and the Parallel Programming Laboratory (PPL) at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

NAMD has an interface to quantum chemistry packages ORCA and MOPAC, as well as a
scripted interface to many other quantum packages. Together with Visual 
Molecular Dynamics (VMD) and QwikMD, NAMD’s interface provides access to 
hybrid QM/MM simulations in an integrated, comprehensive, customizable, and 
easy-to-use suite.
