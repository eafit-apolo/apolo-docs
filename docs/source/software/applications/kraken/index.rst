Kraken
======

[1]_ Kraken 2 is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification system using
     exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds.
     This classifier matches each k-mer within a query sequence to the lowest common
     ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing the given k-mer.
     The k-mer assignments inform the classification algorithm.
