GATK4
=====

GATK [1]_, pronounced "Gee Ay Tee Kay" (not "Gat-Kay"), stands for 
GenomeAnalysisToolkit. It is a collection of command-line tools for analyzing 
high-throughput sequencing data with a primary focus on variant discovery. The 
tools can be used individually or chained together into complete workflows. We 
provide end-to-end workflows, called GATK Best Practices, tailored for specific 
use cases.
