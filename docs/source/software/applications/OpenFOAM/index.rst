turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics. More...

OpenFOAM is professionally released every six months to include customer sponsored developments and contributions
from the community, including the OpenFOAM Foundation. Releases designated OpenFOAM+ contain several man years of
client-sponsored developments of which much has been transferred to, but not released in the OpenFOAM Foundation branch.

It is independently tested by ESI-OpenCFD's Application Specialists, Development Partners and selected customers,
and supported by ESI's worldwide infrastructure, values and commitment.

Quality assurance is based on rigorous testing. The process of code evaluation, verification and
validation includes several hundred daily unit tests, a medium-sized test battery run on a weekly basis, and
large industry-based test battery run prior to new version releases. Tests are designed to assess regression behaviour,
memory usage, code performance and scalability.
