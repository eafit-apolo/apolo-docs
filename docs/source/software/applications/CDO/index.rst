Description
-----------

The Climate Data Operators (CDO) software is a collection of many operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data. The operators include simple statistical and arithmetic functions, data selection and subsampling tools, and spatial interpolation. CDO was developed to have the same set of processing functions for GRIB [GRIB] and NetCDF [NetCDF] datasets in one package.
