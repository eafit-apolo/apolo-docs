REPET 2.5
=========

.. contents:: Table of Contents


Basic information
-----------------

- **Official Website:** https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET
- **License:** CeCILL License 2.0
- **Tested on** CentOS (x86_64) â‰¥ 6.6 (Rocks 6.2)

Installation
------------

.. note:: Official installation instructions can be found in https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET/INSTALL.

A detailed list of dependencies can be found at https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET/INSTALL#dependencies. Notice that every executable that is needed by REPET should be reachable from your PATH. Be aware that the cause of most of the errors when running REPET is due to the malfunction of a dependency.

The tar file containing REPET can be found `here`_. The compressed package already contains the binaries so there is no need to compile anything. Once you have uncompressed REPET and installed all the dependencies you should configure your environment so that every program needed is in your PATH. Also, you should configure PYTHONPATH evironment variable, so that every REPET python module is reachable.

.. _here: https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$REPET_HOME

For more information on setting up your REPET environment you should follow the guide provided in the beginning of the following web page: https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET/TEdenovo-tuto.

REPET needs a MySQL server. Instructions to configure a MySQL server can be found on this `link`_. You also need to create a database and a user for REPET:

.. _link: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-installation.html

.. code-block:: mysql

    # tables engine must be MyISAM
    mysql> SET default_storage_engine=MYISAM;    

    # in order to avoid errors regarding character encoding
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE database_name CHARACTER  set utf8 COLLATE  utf8_bin;

    # create user and grant privileges on database
    mysql> CREATE USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    mysql> GRANT ALL ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'hostname';
    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Repet needs a working environment with some python modules installed:

.. code-block:: bash   

   # load REPET module
   $ module load REPET

   # create a conda environment named env_name and install mysql-python, pyyaml as needed for REPET
   $ conda create mysql-python pyyaml -n env_name

.. note:: REPET module will load python/2.7.15_miniconda-4.5.4 automatically

If you want to use REPET with RepeatMasker:
    * The first time you run :bash:`module load REPET` you will have to move into RepeatMasker directory and run :bash:`perl ./configure`. 

.. code-block:: bash

          $ cd $HOME/RepeatMasker
          $ perl ./configure

It will prompt you to enter the path for some applications. You should enter the following:

.. code-block:: 

        # perl path
        Enter path: env

        # RepeatMasker path
        Enter path: /home/<your_username>/RepeatMasker

        # TRF path
        Enter path: /share/apps/REPET/2.5/third_party/others/bin/

        # RMblast path
        Enter path: /share/apps/REPET/2.5/third_party/rmblast/2.9.0/bin/

* Be aware that RepeatMasker comes by default with the open Dfam database. If you want to use RepBase library you should copy the compressed version to RepeatMasker's top directory and uncompress it from there. Then reconfigure RepeatMasker:

.. code-block:: bash
        
          $ module load REPET
          $ cp RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar.gz $HOME/RepeatMasker/
          $ cd $HOME/RepeatMasker
          $ gunzip RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar.gz
          $ tar xvf RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar
          $ rm RepBaseRepeatMaskerEdition-########.tar 
          $ perl ./configure

Usage
-----

.. note:: If you don't already have a MySQL account contact the system administrator. Remember to ask for the database name and hostname for the MySQL server.

In order to use REPET you should load REPET module and activate your Python environment:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ module load REPET

    $ source activate env_name

REPET's main pipelines are TEdenovo and TEannot. Each of them has it's specific guidelines and dependencies. REPET provides vast documentation for this pipelines: https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET/TEdenovo-tuto, https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Tools/REPET/TEannot-tuto.

REPET implements a module for using resource managers such as :ref:`SLURM <slurm-index>` or TORQUE. It will use this module to send jobs to a queue. In order to manage SBATCH parameters you will have to edit the configuration file for the pipeline you are using (e.g. TEdenovo.cfg). Each job has it's own parameters, which can be specified as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    resources: longjobs --partition=longjobs --time=03:00:00 --out=out.log --error=err.log

This entry will make TEdenovo.py use longjobs as the partition. The job will have 3 hours to finish. The job will redirect stdout to out.log and stderr to err.log. 

The first word must be the partition where you want your job to be sent. Even though, you should specify the partition again using "\--partition=<partition_name>". It is mandatory to specify the partition as well as the time for the job to finish.

If for some reason some step did not finish as expected and you do not get an error message, you should erase all data on jobs table, so REPET can use :ref:`SLURM <slurm-index>` to launch jobs again:

.. code-block:: bash
        
        # connect to your MySQL server
        $ mysql -u <MySQL_username> -h <MySQL_server_hostname> -p

        # select your database
        mysql> USE <your_database>;

        # erase all data in the table
        mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE jobs;

.. note:: If getting the following error: **ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host 'not.your.hostname.com' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server** you should try creating the user using the ip from which you will connect and then add "skip-name-resolve" to MySQL configuration:
    .. code-block:: yaml

                    [mariadb]
                    skip-name-resolve
    
Also, be aware that almost all steps create a directory in which will be the output files from those specific steps. If your step failed, there will be the logs along with the files the step produced.

:ref:`SLURM <slurm-index>` scripts for REPET:
    * We provide the scripts and config files needed to run REPET on our cluster: https://github.com/eafit-apolo/apolo-scripts/tree/master/REPET.
    * You should modify some values accordingly (e.g. you project name or MySQL username on .cfg files).
    * This scripts are based on https://github.com/stajichlab/REPET-slurm. More information on the usage for this scripts can be found there.
