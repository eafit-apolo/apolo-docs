TopHat is a bioinformatic sequence analysis packet tool for fast and high-performance
alignment of cDNA sequencing readings generated by transcriptomic technologies
(eg, RNA-Seq) using Bowtie first and then mapping to a reference genome for discover
de novo RNA splice sites. TopHat aligns RNA-Seq readings with mammal size genomes
