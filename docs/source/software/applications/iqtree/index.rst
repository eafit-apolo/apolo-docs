IQ-TREE
=======

The IQ-TREE [1]_ software was created as the successor of IQPNNI and TREE-PUZZLE (thus the name IQ-TREE). IQ-TREE was motivated by the rapid accumulation of phylogenomic data, leading to a need for efficient phylogenomic software that can handle a large amount of data and provide more complex models of sequence evolution. To this end, IQ-TREE can utilize multicore computers and distributed parallel computing to speed up the analysis. IQ-TREE automatically performs checkpointing to resume an interrupted analysis.
