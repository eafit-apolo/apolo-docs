Description
-------------

GARLI, Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference is a program for inferring phylogenetic trees.
Using an approach similar to a classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of evolutionary trees
and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood score. It implements nucleotide, amino acid
and codon-based models of sequence evolution, and runs on all platforms. The latest version adds support for
partitioned models and morphology-like datatypes. It is written and maintained by Derrick Zwickl.
