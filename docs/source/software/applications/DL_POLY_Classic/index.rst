Description
----------------

DL_POLY_Classic is a general-purpose (parallel and serial) molecular dynamics simulation package derived from the
package formally known as DL_POLY_2 (version 20), originally written by W. Smith and TR Forester at Daresbury Laboratory
to support the "Computer Simulation of Condensed Phases "in CCP5. The terms under which this package is available are
described in the DL_POLY_2 source code.

DL_POLY_Classic is different from (DL_POLY_3) DL_POLY_4 packages, which are available from Daresbury Laboratory
under different license terms.
