OpenBLAS
========

In scientific computing, OpenBLAS is an open source implementation of the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) API with many hand-crafted optimizations for specific processor types. It is developed at the Lab of Parallel Software and Computational Science, ISCAS.

    * OpenBLAS adds optimized implementations of linear algebra kernels for several processor architectures, including Intel Sandy Bridge[2] and Loongson.[3] It claims to achieve performance comparable to the Intel MKL.

    * OpenBLAS is a fork of GotoBLAS2, which was created by Kazushige Goto at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.
