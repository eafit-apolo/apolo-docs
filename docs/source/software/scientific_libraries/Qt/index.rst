Qt is developed as a free and open source software through Qt Project, where the community participates, as well as developers from Nokia, Digia and other companies.3 Previously, it was developed by Nokia's Qt software division, which entered effective after Nokia's acquisition of the Norwegian company Trolltech, the original producer of Qt, on June 17, 2008.4 Qt is distributed under the terms of GNU Lesser General Public License and others. On the other hand, Digia has been in charge of Qt commercial licenses since March 2011.
