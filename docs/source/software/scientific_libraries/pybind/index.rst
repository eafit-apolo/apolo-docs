Pybind
======

Pybind [1]_ pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, 
mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are
similar to the excellent Boost.Python library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate 
code in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time 
introspection.
