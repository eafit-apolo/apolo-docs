DMTCP
=====

DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) transparently checkpoints a
single-host or distributed computation in user-space with no modifications to
user code or to the O/S. It works on most Linux applications, including Python,
Matlab, R, etc. [1]_

.. Warning::

   The current Apolo implementation only offers checkpointing support to serial 
   and parallel programs. It isn't compatible with distributed programs like 
   those based on MPI.
