T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment package. You can use T-Coffee to align sequences or to combine
the output of your favorite alignment methods (Clustal, Mafft, Probcons, Muscle...) into one unique alignment (M-Coffee).

T-Coffee can align Protein, DNA and RNA sequences. It is also able to combine sequence information with
protein structural information (3D-Coffee/Expresso), profile information (PSI-Coffee) or RNA secondary structures
(R-Coffee).
