OpenSees
========

OpenSees (the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) is a proprietary object-oriented,
software framework created at the National Science Foundation-sponsored Pacific Earthquake Engineering (PEER) Center.
It allows users to create finite element applications for simulating the response of structural and geotechnical
systems subjected to earthquakes. This framework was developed by Frank McKenna and Gregory L. Fenves with significant
contributions from Michael H. Scott, Terje Haukaas, Armen Der Kiureghian, Remo M. de Souza, Filip C. Filippou,
Silvia Mazzoni, and Boris Jeremic. OpenSees is primarily written in C++ and uses several Fortran numerical libraries
for linear equation solving. [1]_
