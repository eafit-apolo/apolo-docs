Build process
-------------

This entry described the installation process of GATK4.

#. Clone the GATK4 repository.

   .. code-block:: bash
    
      git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk

#. Load the Java module.

   .. code-block:: bash

      module load java/jdk-1.8.0_112

#. Enter the directory and compile it.

   .. note::

      You can choose tha way to build:
      
      - ./gradlew bundle or ./gradlew

        * This creates a zip archive in the build/ directory with a name like gatk-VERSION.zip containing a complete standalone GATK distribution, you can also run GATK commands directly from the root of your git clone after running this command.

      - ./gradlew installDist
        
        * Does a fast build that only lets you run GATK tools from inside your git clone, and locally only (not on a cluster).

      - ./gradlew installAll

        * Does a semi-fast build that only lets you run GATK tools from inside your git clone, but works both locally and on a cluster.

      - ./gradlew localJar

        * Builds only the GATK jar used for running tools locally (not on a Spark cluster). The resulting jar will be in build/libs with a name like gatk-package-VERSION-local.jar, and can be used outside of your git clone.

      - ./gradlew sparkJar

        * Builds only the GATK jar used for running tools on a Spark cluster (rather than locally).

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd gatk
      ./gradlew installDist

#. Move your compile files to the path where you want GATK4.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mv gatk/ /your/path/

#. Create the module.
