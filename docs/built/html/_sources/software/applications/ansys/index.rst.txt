ANSYS
=====

Ansys [1]_ develops and markets finite element analysis software used to simulate
engineering problems. The software creates simulated computer models of structures,
electronics, or machine components to simulate strength, toughness, elasticity,
temperature distribution, electromagnetism, fluid flow, and other attributes.
Ansys is used to determine how a product will function with different specifications,
without building test products or conducting crash tests.[5] For example,
Ansys software may simulate how a bridge will hold up after years of traffic,
how to best process salmon in a cannery to reduce waste, or how to design a slide
that uses less material without sacrificing safety.
